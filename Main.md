# Getting Started
**If you are not familiar with what we are doing, we are making our own executable LUA script Mod Menu for GTA V. 
*(Everything done is for educational and research purposes as we do not condone any of such modifications towards games for advantages and cheating.)***

## First Step
The first step is to download the mod menu template **[Here](https://github.com/stinkybro/stinkybro.github.io/blob/main/Menu/template.lua)**
After downloading, you want to open the file in an editor such as Visual Studio (recommended), notepad, notepad++, etc. Any works.

## Editing
To start off with editing, open the template.lua file we downloaded earlier and go down to line 35 / look for this code:
`MENU_VERSION = "1.0.0"; -- Set this to your desired, example: "ver 1.0" or "Version 69420 funny" it can any way of string
    AUTHOR = "Author"; -- Set this to your name or whatever you want
    DESCRIPTION = "Description for my mod menu."; -- <--Feel free to type in anything in here`
Here, we can change the main information about our script. First up, lets change the menu version AKA "MENU_VERSION". `MENU_VERSION = "1.0.0"; -- Set this to your desired, example: "ver 1.0" or "Version 69420 funny" it can any way of string` Set it's value to whatever you would like.

Second, change the author to your liking aswell. `AUTHOR = "Author"; -- Set this to your name or whatever you want`

And third, same with the description, `DESCRIPTION = "Description for my mod menu."; -- <--Feel free to type in anything in here` change it to whatever you like.
